Lab assignment for the application of an MFD with simulated traffic data of a 2 hour period

This was an assignment for the Intro to Traffic Flow Modeling and Intelligent Transport Systems course provided by EPFL on edX.

It analyzes a 2 hour traffic simulation data using an MFD model.

The 'dataLab1.mat' and 'gplotdc.m' files were given by the course.

The discrete frechet distance used for the analysis was given by Zachary Danziger.

The main code for the analysis is in 'example.m'

Comments and results of the analysis can be found on 'Lab_example.pdf'.
